                                        DataSourceRef) will be set to the same value

                                        the other is non-empty. There are two important
                                        differences between DataSource and DataSourceRef:
                                        * While DataSource only allows two specific
                                        types of objects, DataSourceRef   allows any
                                        non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim
                                        objects. * While DataSource ignores disallowed
                                        values (dropping them), DataSourceRef   preserves
                                        all values, and generates an error if a disallowed
                                        value is   specified. (Beta) Using this field
                                        requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate
                                        to be enabled.'

                              all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value
                              is   specified. (Beta) Using this field requires the

                                      There are two important differences between
                                      DataSource and DataSourceRef: * While DataSource
                                      only allows two specific types of objects, DataSourceRef   allows
                                      any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim
                                      objects. * While DataSource ignores disallowed
                                      values (dropping them), DataSourceRef   preserves
                                      all values, and generates an error if a disallowed
                                      value is   specified. (Beta) Using this field
                                      requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate
                                      to be enabled.'

                                      is less than 5(MinDomains), so \"global minimum\"
                                      is treated as 0. In this situation, new pod
                                      with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                                      because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new
                                      Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                                      it will violate MaxSkew. \n This is a beta field

                                      labelSelector spread as 3/1/1: | zone1 | zone2
                                      | zone3 | | P P P |   P   |   P   | If WhenUnsatisfiable
                                      is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only
                                      be scheduled to zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2)
                                      as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfies
                                      MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can
                                      still be imbalanced, but scheduler won''t make
                                      it *more* imbalanced. It''s a required field.'

                                      domain as a domain whose nodes meet the requirements

                                      There are two important differences between
                                      DataSource and DataSourceRef: * While DataSource
                                      only allows two specific types of objects, DataSourceRef   allows
                                      any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim
                                      objects. * While DataSource ignores disallowed
                                      values (dropping them), DataSourceRef   preserves
                                      all values, and generates an error if a disallowed
                                      value is   specified. (Beta) Using this field
                                      requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate
                                      to be enabled.'

                                volume is desired. This may be any local object from
                                a non-empty API group (non core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim
                                object. When this field is specified, volume binding
                                will only succeed if the type of the specified object
                                matches some installed volume populator or dynamic

                                of the DataSource field and as such if both fields
                                are non-empty, they must have the same value. For
                                backwards compatibility, both fields (DataSource and
                                DataSourceRef) will be set to the same value automatically
                                if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                There are two important differences between DataSource
                                and DataSourceRef: * While DataSource only allows
                                two specific types of objects, DataSourceRef   allows
                                any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim
                                objects. * While DataSource ignores disallowed values
                                (dropping them), DataSourceRef   preserves all values,
                                and generates an error if a disallowed value is   specified.
                                (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource
                                feature gate to be enabled.'

                            <key, value> as a "bucket", and try to put balanced number
                            of pods into each bucket. We define a domain as a particular

                            each Node is a domain of that topology. And, if TopologyKey
                            is "topology.kubernetes.io/zone", each zone is a domain
                            of that topology. It's a required field.

                                      be the owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be
                                      deleted together with the pod.  The name of
                                      the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
                                      `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes`
                                      array entry. Pod validation will reject the
                                      pod if the concatenated name is not valid for
                                      a PVC (for example, too long). \n An existing
                                      PVC with that name that is not owned by the
                                      pod will *not* be used for the pod to avoid
                                      using an unrelated volume by mistake. Starting
                                      the pod is then blocked until the unrelated
                                      PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
                                      meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to
                                      updated with an owner reference to the pod once
                                      the pod exists. Normally this should not be

                                              * While DataSource only allows two specific
                                              types of objects, DataSourceRef   allows
                                              any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim
                                              objects. * While DataSource ignores
                                              disallowed values (dropping them), DataSourceRef   preserves
                                              all values, and generates an error if
                                              a disallowed value is   specified. (Beta)
                                              Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource

                                              types of objects, DataSourceRef   allows
                                              any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim
                                              objects. * While DataSource ignores
                                              disallowed values (dropping them), DataSourceRef   preserves
                                              all values, and generates an error if
                                              a disallowed value is   specified. (Beta)

                                            \n An existing PVC with that name that
                                            is not owned by the pod will *not* be
                                            used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
                                            volume by mistake. Starting the pod is
                                            then blocked until the unrelated PVC is
                                            removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
                                            meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has
                                            to updated with an owner reference to
                                            the pod once the pod exists. Normally
                                            this should not be necessary, but it may
                                            be useful when manually reconstructing

                                          Starting the pod is then blocked until the

                                          be useful when manually reconstructing a

                                                  will replace the functionality of
                                                  the DataSource field and as such

                                                  compatibility, both fields (DataSource
                                                  and DataSourceRef) will be set to
                                                  the same value automatically if

                                                  is non-empty. There are two important
                                                  differences between DataSource and
                                                  DataSourceRef: * While DataSource
                                                  only allows two specific types of
                                                  objects, DataSourceRef   allows
                                                  any non-core object, as well as
                                                  PersistentVolumeClaim objects. *
                                                  While DataSource ignores disallowed
                                                  values (dropping them), DataSourceRef   preserves
                                                  all values, and generates an error
                                                  if a disallowed value is   specified.

                                          MAY choose to support attaching Routes to
                                          other resources. If that is the case, they
                                          MUST clearly document how SectionName is
                                          interpreted. \n When unspecified (empty
                                          string), this will reference the entire
                                          resource. For the purpose of status, an
                                          attachment is considered successful if at
                                          least one section in the parent resource
                                          accepts it. For example, Gateway listeners
                                          can restrict which Routes can attach to
                                          them by Route kind, namespace, or hostname.
                                          If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment
                                          from the referencing Route, the Route MUST
                                          be considered successfully attached. If
                                          no Gateway listeners accept attachment from
                                          this Route, the Route MUST be considered
                                          detached from the Gateway. \n Support: Core"

                          1. Default value is 0. Example: when this is set to 30%,
                          at most 30% of the total number of nodes that should be
                          running the daemon pod (i.e. status.desiredNumberScheduled)
                          can have their a new pod created before the old pod is marked
                          as deleted. The update starts by launching new pods on 30%
                          of nodes. Once an updated pod is available (Ready for at
                          least minReadySeconds) the old DaemonSet pod on that node
                          is marked deleted. If the old pod becomes unavailable for
                          any reason (Ready transitions to false, is evicted, or is
                          drained) an updated pod is immediatedly created on that
                          node without considering surge limits. Allowing surge implies
                          the possibility that the resources consumed by the daemonset
                          on any given node can double if the readiness check fails,
                          and so resource intensive daemonsets should take into account
                          that they may cause evictions during disruption. This is
                          an alpha field and requires enabling DaemonSetUpdateSurge
                          feature gate.'
